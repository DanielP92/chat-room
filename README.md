a basic socket server and client. the client sends data to the server, which then broadcasts this to all clients that are currently connected.

if you wish to clone this for your own use, you will need to update the IP variables at the top of the client and server scripts. the server IP should be the local IP address of your machine (i.e. 192.168.X.X). the client IP should be the public IP of the network that the server is running on.

port forwarding on port 8085 will also need to be set up. the port can be changed by amending the PORT in the client and server scripts.

you can also run this on a local network by setting the client and server IP to the local network IP of your machine.

thank you for checking this out!
